write a python CLI application.
it has these arguments:
(filename) - positional, first after script filename, string
(--outdir) - named argument, string. default: "$(filename-without-extension)-flatpak"
(--tmpdir) - named argument, string. default: "flatpak-extract-$UUID". generate $UUID randomly.
Generated default paths should be relative to the current working directory, not absolute.
the app does the following:
- makes sure outdir doesn't exist
- makes sure tmpdir doesn't exist
- runs CLI commands:
$ ostree init --repo=$tmpdir --mode=bare-user
$ ostree static-delta apply-offline --repo=$tmpdir $filename
- calculates the $commit
$ ostree checkout --repo=repo -U $commit $outdir
- deletes $tmpdir at the end and on errors 
- lists all files in $outdir using this output syntax:
./$outdir/dir1/dir2/file1.txt
$commit should be calculated as follows:
1. traverse all files in $tmpdir/objects and find the file that ends with .commit extension
2. get the base directory of said file (just a name without path in front of it) and concat it with the file name from above. remove extension
